# 🧠 FashionMNIST Loss Landscape Exploration

![FashionMNIST Banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26833433/239359139-ce0a434e-9056-43e0-a306-3214f193dcce.png)

> A bachelor’s project focused on analyzing and visualizing the **loss landscape** of convolutional neural networks trained on the FashionMNIST dataset using PyTorch Lightning.

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository explores how neural network optimization behaves in the context of **loss landscapes**. Using a CNN trained on the FashionMNIST dataset, we analyze curvature, convergence patterns, and training dynamics. The project leverages **modern PyTorch workflows**, advanced scheduling, and visualization tools to investigate deep learning behavior beyond just accuracy metrics.

## 🛠️ Model Architecture

A simple but effective CNN architecture:

```python
Conv2d(1, 32, kernel_size=5) → BatchNorm → ReLU  
→ Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=5) → BatchNorm → ReLU  
→ Flatten → Linear(1024, 128) → ReLU  
→ Linear(128, 64) → ReLU  
→ Linear(64, 10)
```

- **Loss**: CrossEntropyLoss  
- **Optimizer**: AdamW  
- **Scheduler**: OneCycleLR

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/obassler/FashionMnist-OSU.git
cd FashionMnist-OSU

# (Optional) Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run training
python train.py
```

> ⚠️ Make sure you have a GPU for faster training, although CPU works for experimentation.

## 🧪 Experiments

This project is built around **experimenting with the loss landscape** of CNNs:

- 📉 Training dynamics with **OneCycleLR**
- 📊 Model accuracy tracked via `torchmetrics`
- 📈 Visualizations (coming soon) using **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **TensorBoard**
- 🧭 Exploring curvature and optimization smoothness

Plots and visualizations will be available in the `assets/` directory or via TensorBoard logs.
